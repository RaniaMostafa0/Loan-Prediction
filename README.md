Overview:
This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of 614 instances with 13 attributes, we aim to build a model capable of classifying loan applications as approved or not approved. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.
Dataset Description:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following attributes:
- Loan_ID: Unique Loan ID for every applicant.
- Gender: Male/Female.
- Married: Applicant's marital status (Y/N).
- Dependents: Number of dependents (children).
- Education: Applicant's education level (Graduate/Under Graduate).
- Self_Employed: If the applicant is self-employed (Y/N).
- ApplicantIncome: Applicant’s income.
- CoapplicantIncome: Co-applicant’s income.
- LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands.
- Loan_Amount_Term: Term of the loan in months.
- Credit_History: Credit history adherence.
- Property_Area: Urban/Semi-Urban/Rural.
- Loan_Status: Target variable indicating loan approval (Y/N).
Project Workflow:
1. Data Cleaning
- Removing duplicates.
- Handling missing values.
- Correcting data inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identifying patterns and relationships among variables.
- Visualizing data to understand distributions and correlations.
3. Feature Selection
- Selecting the most relevant attributes to improve model accuracy and efficiency.
4. Model Training
- Applying machine learning algorithms to train the prediction model.
5. Model Evaluation
- Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Fine-tuning the model to optimize results.
